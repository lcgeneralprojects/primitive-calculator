This is a primitive calculator project. This project is meant to be an exercise in making GUI applications and a proof of my basic competence at such.

Currently, a user can use the GUI of the application to input numbers to perform the standard arithmetic operations on, choose the arithmetic operation, erase digits, and partially (ignoring the first inputted number) or fully reset the state of the calculator.
